The first game of the tournament is always a little bit more difficult. An early wrong turn, a miscontrolled ball or a badly placed pass can dictate the story of the game. A team that wants to go on to win the tournament need to realise that and manage the raw emotions and the overall energy of those first minutes. Brazil did that in their 2-0 win against Serbia. But let\u2019s be careful. The three points does not guarantee anything, not even progress to the knockout stage. The players need to know that humility and respect is key here and you can never have too much of that.</p><p>Now comes a game against another European competitor, Switzerland. Football is exciting because we will never be able to fully understand it, but a win on Monday and early qualification for the second round is what the coach, Tite, is after. Then he could use the third game to rotate the squad somewhat and try a few different tactical things for the battles ahead.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/nov/28/world-cup-qatar-brazil-look-unified-and-have-strength-in-depth-to-cope-without-neymar\">Continue reading...</a>",

His name is Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, he plays for Werder Bremen, he is 29 years old, 11 days into his international career, and when it mattered most he was there for them: coming on to give his country hope of staying in the World Cup. With just seven minutes to go in just his third game, he thumped a rising shot beyond Unai Sim\u00f3n to level the score, and offer them a lifeline, immediately running to the touchline and into the arms of Hansi Flick, relief all round.</p><p>If some of the jeopardy had been taken from this occasion six hours earlier, Costa Rica\u2019s surprise victory over Japan meaning that Germany took a slight, uneasy step back from the edge of the abyss, this was still a dramatic moment and one that changes everything. F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s goal gives the <em>Mannschaft</em> a footing at this tournament. They will have to defeat Costa Rica and even then their fate remains in Japan\u2019s hands \u2013 and in Spain\u2019s \u2013 but there is hope now. It could have been so much worse. It is not yet done for Spain yet either, although Luis Enrique noted that they still lead the group of death.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/27/spain-germany-world-cup-group-e-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

About 100 officers in riot gear used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the rioters, who lit fires on the street and threw missiles at police.

They are still the only NFL team to have recorded a perfect season</p><p>It\u2019s been 50 years since the 1972 Miami Dolphins became the first (and, so far, only) team in NFL history to win every game in a season. For many who played on the Dolphins that year, it\u2019s hard to reconcile the passage of time with the immediacy of the memories. \u201cFifty years is a long time ago,\u201d laughs Dick Anderson, the Dolphins\u2019 Pro Bowl safety in 1972, but it \u201cfeels like it was yesterday.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s useful to quickly clarify one aspect of the \u201972 Dolphins\u2019 achievement \u2013 for a finicky reason, the phrase \u201cperfect season\u201d (rather than \u201cundefeated season\u201d) is often used to describe the campaign. Although ties are uncommon in today\u2019s game, they were once relatively prevalent. In the 1920s, four teams technically finished their seasons \u2018undefeated,\u2019 although each of them finished with at least one draw. As such, the Dolphins\u2019 lossless <em>and tieless</em> 1972 season remains unique in NFL history. The league itself has acknowledged the team\u2019s peerless performance \u2013 the \u201972 Dolphins were judged to be the greatest team in NFL history during the league\u2019s centennial celebrations in 2019.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/24/miami-dolphins-1972-unbeaten-season-nfl-football-don-shula\">Continue reading...</a>",
