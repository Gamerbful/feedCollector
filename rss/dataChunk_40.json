It was a nasty Test, played on a nasty evening, when winter seemed to have come rushing in all of a sudden on a stiff, swirling wind, and with a lick of drizzle. It was a game of scrums, thumps, slips, smashes, and penalties, played under high pressure.</p><p>And in all that it was, like Cockerill said, everything you would expect from a Test against the Springboks. Thing is, thirty minutes in, it became painfully obvious there was a lot more to this South Africa team too. It was as if England had been so busy looking at the club their opponent had in their right hand that they hadn\u2019t noticed the dagger they were holding behind their back in the left. Because South Africa weren\u2019t so much stronger than England, but they were a whole lot sharper and savvier, the gap between the teams was in the precision of their passing, and the rapier pace they had out wide.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/nov/26/streetwise-south-africa-pick-up-cudgel-and-rapier-to-bury-england\">Continue reading...</a>",

        "description": "<p>The Manchester City midfielder \u2013 currently leading Belgium\u2019s golden generation in their last stab at World Cup glory \u2013 is football\u2019s quiet genius. He gives a rare look at the family life of a Premier League superstar</p><p>Confession. I\u2019m a Manchester City fan. Another confession. Kevin De Bruyne is my favourite player. In 30 years of journalism, I\u2019ve never interviewed a City player. Don\u2019t meet your heroes, they say. The whole thing is discombobulating. De Bruyne \u2013 one of the world\u2019s great players \u2013 has agreed to a rare interview. But there\u2019s a caveat. If you talk to me, he says, you also talk to my wife, my kids, you do it at our home and you get to know us all. Usually, it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 you don\u2019t talk to my family, you don\u2019t come to my home, it\u2019s all about the work rather than the private life. Strange.</p><p>We meet a few weeks before the start of the World Cup. He\u2019s beginning to think about it. But in typical De Bruyne fashion he dispenses with diplomacy and tells it as it is. No, he\u2019s not happy about it being in Qatar. Yes, it is a distraction from the Premier League. No, he doesn\u2019t think Belgium have much chance of winning.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/26/kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city-belgium-world-cup-home-life\">Continue reading...</a>",

A lengthy podcast interview spinning off into an online article and back pages across the News Corp stable, revisiting for the umpteenth time that the former Australian cricket coach is still not happy about his tenure finishing up nine months ago. It feels like the Gabba Test in 2015, when retiring bowler Ryan Harris got a lap of honour on the back of a ute when half of the stadium was closed. By now Langer\u2019s circuit has gone on far too long, leaving a lonely figure waving at empty seats.</p><p>In February his resignation letter said that others wanted a fresh direction and that \u201cI respect that decision\u201d. By May it was clear that - spoiler - he did not respect that decision. He spoke at Western Australia\u2019s Government House about a gruff concreter tearily lamenting his absence, then broadsided Cricket Australia during a speech to the WA Chamber of Commerce. Both before and after resigning his former teammates were his allies, with everyone from Ricky Ponting and Shane Warne down through the ranks using their media jobs in a campaign that shifted from reappointment to disappointment.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/25/justin-langers-endless-grudge-threatens-to-cloud-new-cricket-summer\">Continue reading...</a>",

A manager plus a player must appear at a press conference the day before a game \u2013 only at this World Cup that does not take place at the stadium or a team training ground, but at Fifa\u2019s main media centre in Doha. For Germany, that involves a 210km round trip from their Al Shamal training base on the northern tip of Qatar. For Flick, who knows defeat to an in-form Spain on Sunday will spell almost certain elimination from the tournament, that is no way to prepare for the most loaded assignment of his international reign.

First, the mutual termination of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s contract was announced at 5.30pm and it was later confirmed the Glazer family were open to selling up. Most United fans welcomed the news. Their ageing prima donna was heading for the exit and there was renewed hope the unpopular American owners might pack up.</p><p>It had taken fewer than 10 days from Ronaldo\u2019s melodramatic broadside at United, delivered via Piers Morgan\u2019s knockabout questioning, to the No 7 shirt being vacated. Those in the firing line included the owners, coaches past and present and the club\u2019s training facilities. There was no way back for Ronaldo, not that he wanted one.

        "description": "<p>Three England tries in seven late minutes salvaged a 25-25 draw with New Zealand in a match that had appeared lost</p><p>It seemed to start raining in the final minutes at Twickenham, a shower of fat drops of beer from the clear night sky. They fell as the fans up in the gods leapt to their feet and threw their pints above them. Given what they charge for the stuff around these parts, it is probably not something you would do unless you had lost the run of yourself. But then it has been a long time since Twickenham has seen anything like those crazily helter-skelter final minutes, when England peeled off one, two, three tries in the space of seven minutes, and turned an infamous defeat into a feted draw.</p><p>It was as if, Eddie Jones said later, someone had \u201cthrown magic dust\u201d over them. Could they have pressed on again and tried to win the thing? Marcus Smith decided to kick the ball dead and kill the game instead. Owen Farrell explained later it was a call they had taken together, because they did not think the team had enough forward momentum off the ruck. The bigger question is how the hell they ended up in a position where they even had to make the decision. You would have to watch the match back to begin to figure out exactly how they did it. It was undoubtedly a game of two halves, just that one of them was 70 minutes long!</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/nov/19/twickenham-faithful-rise-to-salute-a-comeback-for-the-ages\">Continue reading...</a>",
