        "description": "<p>Pre-workout nutrition is one of those areas where people love to lose themselves in the minutiae. They obsess over what to eat, when to eat it, and how much of it to eat. Instead of just getting into the gym or out into the world and getting active and lifting something heavy, they read blogs and watch videos for weeks, searching for the one pre-workout meal to rule them all.\u00a0They end up avoiding the gym altogether because they can't figure out the \"perfect\" pre-workout meal, or whether they should eat something at all. Even when you figure out what to eat before a workout, you can go too far.\u00a0You know the type of guy. This is the guy who travels with a suitcase full of powders, pills, and packaged foods. He\u2019s so wedded to the pre-workout ritual that he can\u2019t skip a day\u2014even on vacation. If he doesn\u2019t get his 40.5 grams of waxy maize, 30.2 grams of whey isolate, and preworkout blend of superfoods he can\u2019t operate in the gym. He crumbles without the perfect, most optimal pre-workout nutrition. Don't be like this. Let me tell you what to do so you can stop stressing about what to eat before a workout. Let's simplify things. General Rules for Pre Workout Meals What you eat will depend on what kind of workout you're doing, what your goals are, and what kind of diet you're already following, but there are general rules that apply to everyone. Keep things light. No heavy meals. If you eat too large a meal, you may have trouble digesting it, or some of the energy that'd otherwise go to your muscles will be diverted to your gut. Eat foods you know you can easily digest. No surprises. Salt your meals. Sodium is an enormous boon to exercise performance, particularly if you'r on the lower-carb side of things. Powders are fine. While whole foods are usually ideal, for quick pre-workout nutrition, protein and carbohydrate powders can be very helpful and beneficial. Include 15-20 g collagen and 50-100 mg vitamin C. This a great way to improve connective tissue health when taken pre-workout. Protein and carbs are more important, dietary fat less important pre-workout. If all goes well you'll be eating the fat on your body. Oh, and you don't\u00a0have to eat anything. You\u00a0can fast (it's what I typically do). It's just that this article is intended to help people who are interested in pre workout nutrition.. What to Eat Before High Intensity Interval Workouts Since running, cycling, and rowing sprints and intervals burn through a ton of glycogen, most conventional sources recommend ample carbohydrates before the workout\u2014around 4 grams per kilo of bodyweight in the hours leading up to the session. These aren't \"wrong.\" If you're a serious high intensity athlete training to compete or perform at very high levels, you should eat a good amount of carbs before your training sessions. That\u00a0will maximize force output and optimize subsequent training adaptations. And besides, you're burning through your &#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/what-to-eat-before-a-workout/\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> \"What to Eat Before a Workout\"</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/what-to-eat-before-a-workout/\" rel=\"nofollow\">What to Eat Before a Workout</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark&#039;s Daily Apple</a>.</p>",

        "title": "My Early Morning Routine",
        "description": "<p>Morning is a sacred time for me. When our kids were still living with us, morning was the only time I had totally to myself. It allowed me to get the day started on my terms, set the tempo for the rest of the day. The kids are out on their own now, it's just me and my wife, but the morning remains crucial to the rest of the day.\u00a0Every morning is a blank slate. Every morning you get to start over, the promise and potential of the near future filled to bursting. And so my early morning routine is the foundation of my day. Without it, the day just doesn't \"take.\" If you want to be \"agile\" and \"intuitive\" in your life, a morning routine helps. You need the foundation from which to leverage your talents and express your intuition and dynamic capacity. If your mornings are slapdash and all over the place, you'll have trouble venturing out into the world and conquering your goals. A child needs security to grow. You need a morning routine to excel. Here's my early morning routine. Go to bed between 10 and 11. A morning routine starts with your nighttime routine. As I've said many times before, getting to bed at a good time\u2014around 10, but no later than 11\u2014while maintaining proper sleep hygiene practices so that you get enough sleep and wake up with energy and vitality is\u00a0essential for a good morning. So your morning routine begins the night before. You have to get a good night's sleep if your early morning routine is going to help you. Wake up at around 7. I wake up around the same time every day\u2014mostly because I'm so religious about getting to bed at a good time. Seven o'clock is my typical wake up time. This allows me to get to bed between 10 and 11 and still get all the sleep I need. I'm in bed by 10, and usually earlier, but I'll read in bed. Sometimes I go out fast, other times I stay up and keep reading. A 7 AM wakeup gives me breathing room at night. Waking up at the same time every day is essential. For one, you don't need an alarm. You just wake up because your body knows, and it's much easier this way. Two, waking up is the start of your routine. Everything hinges on wakeup occurring at the same time. If you wake up at 5 one day and 8:30 another, it's difficult to plan any kind of consistent morning routine. Get sun in my eyes. Sun exposure early in the morning\u2014sunrise, ideally\u2014helps your circadian rhythm hew to the rhythm of the day. It \"tells\" your internal clocks that it's morning, that it's time to get moving, that it's time to build and go. I've always made it a point in my adult life to live in places that get ample sunlight year round. Earlier in my health journey, this wasn't a conscious decision.

        "description": "<p>Ah, peppermint. It\u2019s a classic scent and flavor that just about everyone enjoys. What are your positive associations with peppermint? Candies snuck to you by your grandmother, minty fresh breath, peppermint hot chocolate or lattes on a cold winter morning? And it\u2019s not just for culinary treats and oral care. Oil distilled from the peppermint plant\u2014scientific name Mentha x piperita\u2014is broadly useful for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Peppermint oil contains beneficial compounds, notably high levels of menthol, which give it antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. I\u2019m not really an essential oils guy, but lavender oil and peppermint oil are two we usually have on hand because they are so multifunctional. Here are some research-backed benefits of peppermint.\u00a0 6 Reasons to Use Peppermint Oil Peppermint Oil Helps with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) I know from personal experience how IBS symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and cramping affect day-to-day quality of life. For me, removing grains and adopting a Primal lifestyle have made all the difference, but if you\u2019re still dealing with IBS symptoms, peppermint oil might help.\u00a0 Two recent meta-analyses concluded that enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are significantly better than placebo at relieving pain and global IBS symptoms. It\u2019s also effective for kids. Possibly it works by decreasing muscle spasms, killing pathogens, relieving pain directly, and/or reducing inflammation. Peppermint Oil for Headaches This might be one of the oldest traditional uses for peppermint. Contemporary studies confirm that peppermint oil applied topically or intranasally can provide headache relief on par with traditional pain relievers or lidocaine.\u00a0 Mix a drop or two of peppermint essential oil in a carrier oil like jojoba. Use your fingertips to massage the oil into your temples, being careful not to get too close to your eyes. (Trust me, peppermint plus eyeballs is not a good combo.) Or add 5 to 10 drops of peppermint oil to a diffuser and practice some resonance breathing. This is especially great if you have a tension headache.\u00a0 Prevent Nausea and Vomiting A buddy of mine had surgery a while back. As part of the post-op care, the hospital offered him the option of aromatherapy\u2014choosing between a few different scents, including peppermint, which he could sniff to control post-surgical nausea and vomiting. And it worked, which he thought was pretty cool. I've since heard of other hospitals starting to use this approach. In a couple studies I looked at, not only does peppermint oil mitigate nausea and vomiting, patients preferred it to antiemetic drugs. Peppermint oil aromatherapy has proven effective postoperatively, as my friend can attest, during pregnancy, and while undergoing chemotherapy. Products containing peppermint oil can also help with motion sickness. Possibly Relieve Itching Chronic itching, called pruritus, can drive you up a wall. Two small studies suggest peppermint oil might help. In one, participants applied either peppermint oil or petroleum jelly over areas of chronic itch twice daily for two weeks. In the other, pregnant women took either a placebo or peppermint oil diluted in sesame oil twice a day orally &#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/peppermint-essential-oil-uses-benefits/\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> \"Peppermint Essential Oil: Uses and Benefits\"</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/peppermint-essential-oil-uses-benefits/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peppermint Essential Oil: Uses and Benefits</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark&#039;s Daily Apple</a>.</p>",

Elle has long worked to help people with thyroid conditions advocate for themselves and find their way back to better health. Now she has a new course that is sure to help many more. Check it out! Throughout my life I have come to realize that no one cares more about your health and wellbeing than you. This is why, in the event that you get diagnosed with a disease or health condition, it is critical to learn all that you can about the topic\u2014because you might be able to help yourself by helping your doctor help you. It is called the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d for good reason\u2026 science and medicine evolve and change over time but unfortunately, uninformed doctors do not grow and change with it. When you dive deep into whatever is ailing you, often you can learn something that can help your doctor practice medicine with you and move beyond their shallow understanding of a medical topic. Such is the case with thyroid conditions. There are too many doctors practicing outdated conventional thyroid wisdom, and as a result, hypothyroid patients are still suffering. Some patients lament, \u201cI have been struggling with thyroid issues for 15 years!\u201d No one should ever struggle for years and years, because every single thyroid condition is fixable. EVERY SINGLE THYROID CONDITION IS FIXABLE. IF YOU HAVE NOT FIXED YOUR THYROID ISSUES YET - IT IS LIKELY DUE TO ONE (OR BOTH) OF THESE REASONS: You are dealing with an uninformed doctor, endocrinologist or practitioner who is clueless about how to solve it. YOU are uninformed about your disease and therefore cannot help yourself nor help your doctor practice medicine with you in order to fix it. Anyone struggling with thyroid issues for years is solely the result of being with a doctor who is uninformed about ordering the correct lab work, properly diagnosing and accurately assessing that lab work, and then treating the patient effectively and efficiently. You also need to be informed in order to solve hypothyroidism, Hashimoto\u2019s, reverse T3 hypothyroidism, post radioactive iodine treatment (RAI), post thyroidectomy (removal of the thyroid gland often due to thyroid cancer), and Graves disease (hyperthyroidism). Thyroid 101 The thyroid is the master gland of the human body. The thyroid gland controls the metabolic rate of every organ in the body, from the production and regulation of sex hormones, adrenal hormones, body temperature, growth development, brain function, and heart rate to every other element that keeps your body functioning. Inadequate thyroid hormones in the human body will ultimately contribute to a miserable existence, likely rampant with diseases, health problems, and accelerated aging. Over 200 million people worldwide and over 25 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease, yet 60% are undiagnosed and unaware of their condition. Undiagnosed or mistreated hypothyroidism can put people at risk for serious conditions, such as depression, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type &#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/becoming-your-own-thyroid-advocate/\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> \"Becoming Your Own Thyroid Advocate\"</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/becoming-your-own-thyroid-advocate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Becoming Your Own Thyroid Advocate</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark&#039;s Daily Apple</a>.</p>",

        "title": "How to Get Over Jet Lag",
        "description": "<p>People often ask me about my \u201clatest\u201d jet lag protocol. Do I have any new tips, tricks, tools, supplements, or devices that I swear by to get over jet lag when flying? No, and here\u2019s why: My basic jet lag protocol already works so well that there\u2019s absolutely no reason to try including any newfangled hacks, tips, or pills. It\u2019s based entirely on human circadian biology, which hasn\u2019t changed for hundreds of thousands of years. I literally never get jet lag if I stick to my methods. And I put it to the test on a regular basis, traveling quite extensively on transcontinental flights. Jet lag is supposed to get worse with age, but it's only gotten easier and easier for me. The experts would have you believe that each hour of time zone change requires one full day to adjust. That was certainly true for me in my 20s when I went to Europe without knowing anything about circadian rhythms, but it doesn't have to be that way. You don't have to get jet lag. You shouldn't. And I'm going to tell you how to avoid it. Let\u2019s get right into it. Preparing for Flying East vs. West To begin with, how you treat the flight is going to differ somewhat based on what direction you\u2019re flying. Preparing for Flying East Break eastbound overnight flights into two short \u201cdays\u201d. If you\u2019re doing a big flight east, heading over the Atlantic or Pacific to new lands, it will generally be an overnighter. With that in mind, break your flight up into two short \u201cdays.\u201d If the flight is eight hours, the first four hours are \u201cnight\u201d and the last four are \u201cday.\u201d If it\u2019s 16 hours, the first eight are nighttime and the last eight are day. Sleep at \u201cnight\u201d.\u00a0Sleep as much as you can, as early as you can, during the \u201cnighttime\u201d portion of the flight. This will help normalize your circadian biology and get your body into the \u201cmindset\u201d of day and night. Don't eat at \"night.\" Stay awake during the \u201cday\u201d. Act just like you do in normal daytime. Read, work, catch up on emails, watch movies. Just stay awake. If it were acceptable to walk the aisles, I'd say walk the aisles. Get all your calories in during the \u201cday\u201d. You don\u2019t have to eat, but if you\u2019re going to eat, do so in the \u201cdaytime\u201d portion of the flight. Preparing for Flying West For long flights west, a short nap in the middle is fine. Let your body decide to sleep or not. Just don't\u00a0sleep so long that you end up having trouble sleeping at the new location when night comes. Eat, or not. But don't overdo it. Inflight Tips for Avoiding Jet Lap Consider fasting Fasting has been shown to help stave off jet lag, so fasting can actually help you adapt to the new time zone.

        "title": "Natural and Alternative Eczema Treatments",
        "description": "<p>Dry, red, itchy skin? Chances are you have eczema. Or rather, chances are you have one of the many skin conditions that doctors lump together under the term \u201ceczema.\u201d It\u2019s extremely common, affecting up to 20 percent of children and 5 percent of adults (and considerably more in some parts of the world). And it\u2019s also incredibly frustrating when you\u2019re trying to find solutions.\u00a0 People of any age can develop eczema, but it\u2019s more common in babies and children. I\u2019ve frequently had readers write to me over the years expressing their frustration and dismay over their inability to solve their children\u2019s\u2014or their own\u2014eczema puzzle. Unfortunately, treating eczema is tricky for several reasons. The underlying causes aren\u2019t well understood. People have idiosyncratic triggers that can be hard to identify. Sometimes, recommended treatments actually make symptoms worse.\u00a0 As with other common skin issues like psoriasis, the onus often falls on patients or their parents to experiment on their own to find the combination of remedies that works for them. Today we\u2019ll cover some natural therapies that can help stop the itch and calm down inflamed, angry eczema rashes. What Causes Eczema? Doctors don\u2019t necessarily have to understand the root cause of a particular affliction to treat it effectively, but it sure does help. In the case of eczema, the root cause(s) remain elusive. We know that the skin\u2019s barrier becomes disrupted and skin cells aren\u2019t able to hold moisture. There\u2019s certainly a genetic component. But eczema is also triggered by environmental exposures to things like mold and secondhand smoke, and some women develop eczema for the first time when they become pregnant.\u00a0 It has something to do with the immune system, and folks with eczema are more likely than the average person to have one or more autoimmune diseases. But it\u2019s not an autoimmune issue like psoriasis. People with food or environmental allergies are more likely to have eczema, and allergic reactions can cause eczema to flare up. But it is not itself an allergic condition.\u00a0 I came across this great quote from one Dr. E. D. Chipman writing in the California State Journal of Medicine in 1914: \u201cEczema was defined by Bateman 100 years ago as \u2018a non-contagious eruption, generally the effect of an irritant, whether externally or internally applied, but occasionally produced by a great variety of irritants in persons whose skin is constitutionally very irritable.\u2019 It has been said that this definition cannot be improved upon today.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Another hundred years on, and that still seems to sum it up. People with eczema are especially sensitive to things happening sometimes inside and sometimes outside their bodies for reasons that aren't always clear.\u00a0 8 Alternative and Natural Eczema Treatments As common as eczema is, there isn\u2019t all that much research into treatment options, particularly not natural or alternative (read: non-prescription) treatments. Many proposed remedies are based on anecdotal evidence, often from parents-turned-citizen-scientists desperate to help their children.\u00a0 Nevertheless, start by talking to a doctor and getting a proper diagnosis if you &#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/natural-eczema-treatments/\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> \"Natural and Alternative Eczema Treatments\"</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/natural-eczema-treatments/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural and Alternative Eczema Treatments</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark&#039;s Daily Apple</a>.</p>",

        "title": "Ask a Health Coach: How Do I Feel More Confident?",
        "description": "<p>Hey folks, Board-Certified Health Coach Chloe Maleski is here to answer your questions about having patience and boosting confidence. Struggling to stay the course over the long haul? Feeling insecure about your wellness choices? We\u2019re here with backup! Have a question you\u2019d like to ask our health coaches? Leave it below in the comments or over in the Mark\u2019s Daily Apple Facebook group.\u00a0 &#160; Sandra asked: \u201cThis might be off topic, but do you have tips for cultivating patience? I struggle with it when it comes to seeing changes from working out (muscle tone, strength, etc.) and in all other areas. I don\u2019t like to wait and find myself getting irritated at how long it takes to see results.\u201d That\u2019s not off topic at all, Sandra! As a coach, I work with athletes and others seeking to get and stay fit. Whether when it comes to working out or Primal eating and living, meaningful change usually takes commitment, persistence, patience, and time. This is all the more true when we\u2019re talking about change that is sustainable, rather than a one-off win or achievement. I realize that \u201cwaiting around\u201d isn\u2019t the most fun or exciting part of change efforts! One way I like to reframe it is thinking of patience as powerful rather than passive. This shift in narrative reminds us that we\u2019re doing big, important work with each step, each workout, each meal, day after day. Over time, daily disciplines create a stronger, deeper foundation. When results come\u2014and they will come!\u2014they are real and have this foundation to stand on. In today\u2019s world, things tend to move fast and we are bombarded by promises of new \u201csolutions\u201d and \u201cquick fixes.\u201d In truth, the actual solutions are often quite simple (and not even that surprising). The 10 Primal Blueprint Laws, for instance, are guidelines that align with our very biology and our (long, slow, patient) evolution. Putting them into practice is another thing entirely, however. Not that doing so has to be hard\u2014it doesn\u2019t! But their impact comes from consistency over time, rather than doing them for one day or one week. Most of us took many years if not decades to get where we are with eating, movement, lifestyle, and health. Changing any or all of those in a significant way takes at least 21 to 30 days of really showing up for the process. Typically, patience lags around the midway mark of any challenge, plan, or program. This is a great time to recommit to your \u201cwhy,\u201d read through some success stories for inspiration, and lean into a likeminded community or coach. Doing so can reinforce your trust in the process and serve as a reminder of why the heck you\u2019re putting in the effort! Show Up, Be Present Another thing I\u2019ll mention comes from my personal practice and how I\u2019ve cultivated patience in fitness and life generally: Whatever I\u2019m doing, I show up fully, without fixating on outcomes. By prioritizing presence rather than results, I\u2019m able to see &#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/ask-a-health-coach-how-do-i-feel-more-confident/\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> \"Ask a Health Coach: How Do I Feel More Confident?\"</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com/ask-a-health-coach-how-do-i-feel-more-confident/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ask a Health Coach: How Do I Feel More Confident?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.marksdailyapple.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark&#039;s Daily Apple</a>.</p>",
