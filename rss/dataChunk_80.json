Now you can literally see his work bounce into your physical space with the new Andy Warhol: Pop Up Pop Art Book, The Silver Factory. An interactive and engaging exploration of the artist\u2019s career through the playful medium of a pop-up book, Popostion Press collaborated with The Andy Warhol Foundation to bring the artist\u2019s work to a 3D platform, regenerating his work with its original brash intent \u2014bold, bright, and literally in your face. The book features the Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans, Banana, Andy\u2019s Photo Booth, Marilyn Monroe, Flowers, Brillo Box Sculptures, and his famed Self-Portrait.</div>",
